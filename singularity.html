                                    Inspiration I - We have been reading quite a lot about AR, VR and mixed reality, Google glass, Microsoft hololens lately. It just gives me feeling that we have started capturing our memories, experiences, and emotions in a more quantitative and tangible form; as if we can transcend ourselves into an alternate reality of past, future or may be a completely surreal entity any time we want.

                                    Inspiration II - I came across the few photo editing applications like prisma, Google deep dream projects. I found the process brilliant. You teach a machine to recognize distinctive features and styles of famous artist like Picasso or van gogh, collect the data points , take a secondary image and apply your algorithm. Viola! the next morning you wake up, your facebook wall doesn't look the way it did.

                                    We, as designers follow some specific thought process to reach to a certain decision(But, of course there are exception who don't play by the rule!). Let me put it more clearly, let's say my typical client gives me design brief where he says "<em>I want a sporty logo, with a touch of tradition , it would be great if you incorporate our mascot in it</em>". At first, it seems like a nightmare to any graphic designer. humans are so used to their muscle memory and the way they perceive a problem after a certain time they find it hard to create a disruptive form, a divine form that no human can ever think of with the given his IQ. So how could we create disruptive designs?
                                   

                                    <br><br>
                                    Here comes the <b>Artificial Creative</b>.We give inputs like masculine form(more edge and diagonal),  sporty (spontaneous line quality) , traditional (a color scheme picked of from traditional set of images). Parameters can vary from 5 to 50.our artificial creative could quickly generate forms either 2D or 3D, which can act as a primary base for disruptive form generation. Further, can augment human creativity. possibilities are endless.
                                    This is what I call the culmination of creativity and visual thinking

                                    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-4">
                                    
                                    <br><br>
                                    One fine summer evening, while playing a Pink Floyd track, I could hear every single note of my guitar, associate the combination of musical notes to a distant memory. as if those notes could transcend me into a space, I had never seen, an emotion I had never known earlier. There was something personal and universal about those notes and my guitar in that transient moment. As if I could speak to my alter-ego within. Eventually I ended up floating amidst a train of thoughts.

 <br> <br>

What led to communication is it the structure of our brain, the way we are evolved, our social upbringing some neural level firing or an intergalactic source that created an enigmatic spark in human brain. A brain that could differentiate between “Au” and “ka” (Devanagari script). A brain that could recognize all those words associate them with a memory, form a communication, a brain that would evolve from vedas to genetic algorithm and artificial intelligence. DO we find a similarity? Humans recognize patterns well the same pattern that stores visceral, olfactory stimulus in different parts of brain and create a perception of a whole flower. It’s fascinating to think how smelling a flower or listening a music fires neural patterns in brain and we recognize those and train ourselves to remember  and retrieve those normal yet bizarre informations.
 <br> <br>
 

Despite of all these research on natural language processing, I still believe that there can be changed something in very fundamental level. for an instance, the way we communicate with other humans and machine. We use verbal language to talk to our neighbor, we use physical body language to express love and anger, we use gestures to talk to our smart phones, we write codes to train machines. Moreover, there are brilliant assistive technologies that augment human senses. It seems like as if we are so accustomed the word “communication” itself that we don’t even realize there was a time when humans could differentiate between sounds, remember its pitch and frequency, could even process and remember those sounds.

  <br> <br>

Now, I pick a G Minor chord and think what if I could translate my thoughts into a system just like I am having a conversation or a trained human who doesn’t use conventional senses of information (the gain and retrieval loop) instead he uses trained augmented senses. So could we augment our senses, push our brain to a limit where it can recognize and differentiate those sounds (or any other pattern in haptic,  light, peripheral vision ) and create story out of it? Are we just limited by our senses or the capability of human brains which has a limit to perceive things up to a certain point. What if there are other parts of brain which can actually trigger unconventional medium of communication? what if some species who is part of another parabolic disk use that medium sitting right next you? </b></p>
